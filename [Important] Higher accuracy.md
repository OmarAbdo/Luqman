Improving your stock prediction model is a multifaceted challenge that can be approached from various angles, including enhancing the model architecture, incorporating diverse data sources, and enriching the sentiment analysis component. Below, I outline comprehensive strategies across these dimensions to help you build a more robust and insightful predictive system.

---

# 1. Enhancing the Model Architecture

### a. Multi-Input and Multi-Output Models

**Description:** Instead of training separate models for different data types (e.g., historical prices, technical indicators, fundamental data), you can design a unified architecture that handles multiple inputs and produces multiple outputs.

**Benefits:**

- **Integrated Learning:** The model can learn complex interactions between different data types.
- **Efficiency:** Reduces redundancy by sharing layers across different inputs.

**Implementation Tips:**

- Separate Input Layers: Use distinct input layers for each data type (e.g., one for historical prices, another for technical indicators).
- Shared Layers: Combine these inputs in shared layers (e.g., concatenation followed by LSTM layers).
- Custom Loss Functions: If predicting multiple outputs (e.g., price direction and volatility), use custom loss functions to handle different objectives.

**Example Architecture:**

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, LSTM, Dense, Concatenate

# Historical Price Input
price_input = Input(shape=(timesteps, price_features), name='price_input')
price_lstm = LSTM(64, return_sequences=False)(price_input)

# Technical Indicators Input
tech_input = Input(shape=(timesteps, tech_features), name='tech_input')
tech_lstm = LSTM(64, return_sequences=False)(tech_input)

# Fundamental Data Input
fund_input = Input(shape=(fund_features,), name='fund_input')  # Assuming fundamental data is static

# Concatenate all
concat = Concatenate()([price_lstm, tech_lstm, fund_input])

# Fully Connected Layers
dense1 = Dense(128, activation='relu')(concat)
dense2 = Dense(64, activation='relu')(dense1)

# Output Layer
output = Dense(1, activation='linear')(dense2)  # Predicting next price

# Model
model = Model(inputs=[price_input, tech_input, fund_input], outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
```

### b. Ensemble Models

**Description:** Combine multiple models (e.g., LSTM, GRU, CNN) to leverage their individual strengths.

**Benefits:**

- **Robustness:** Reduces the variance and improves generalization.
- **Performance:** Often achieves better performance than single models.

**Implementation Tips:**

- **Model Diversity:** Use different architectures or training subsets to ensure diversity.
- **Aggregation Methods:** Average the predictions, use weighted averages, or train a meta-model to combine outputs.

**Example Approach:**

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, GRU, Dense, Conv1D, Flatten
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingRegressor

# Define individual models
def create_lstm_model():
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(64, input_shape=(timesteps, features)))
    model.add(Dense(1))
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    return model

def create_gru_model():
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(GRU(64, input_shape=(timesteps, features)))
    model.add(Dense(1))
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    return model

def create_cnn_model():
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Conv1D(64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(timesteps, features)))
    model.add(Flatten())
    model.add(Dense(1))
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    return model

# Instantiate models
lstm = create_lstm_model()
gru = create_gru_model()
cnn = create_cnn_model()

# Fit models individually
lstm.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, verbose=0)
gru.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, verbose=0)
cnn.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, verbose=0)

# Ensemble Predictions
import numpy as np

predictions = np.column_stack([
    lstm.predict(X_test),
    gru.predict(X_test),
    cnn.predict(X_test)
])

ensemble_pred = np.mean(predictions, axis=1)
```

### c. Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN)

**Description:** Utilize attention mechanisms to allow the model to focus on relevant parts of the input data dynamically.

**Benefits:**

- **Interpretability:** Attention weights can provide insights into which features or time steps are most influential.
- **Performance:** Can improve model accuracy by emphasizing important patterns.

**Implementation Tips:**

- Attention Layers: Incorporate attention layers after LSTM/GRU layers to weigh the importance of each time step.
- Multi-Level Attention: For multi-input models, apply attention at different hierarchy levels (e.g., feature-wise and time-wise).

**Example Using TensorFlow/Keras:**

````python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Layer
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K
from tensorflow.keras import initializers

class Attention(Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(Attention, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.W = self.add_weight(name='att_weight', shape=(input_shape[-1], 1),
                                 initializer='random_normal', trainable=True)
        super(Attention, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, x):
        e = K.tanh(K.dot(x, self.W))
        a = K.softmax(e, axis=1)
        output = x * a
        return K.sum(output, axis=1)

    def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
        return (input_shape[0], input_shape[-1])

# Incorporate into a model
price_input = Input(shape=(timesteps, price_features), name='price_input')
price_lstm = LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)(price_input)
price_attention = Attention()(price_lstm)

# Similarly for other inputs...


# 2. Incorporating Diverse Data Sources

- **Enhanced Predictions:** Fundamental data can capture long-term trends and intrinsic value changes.

**Implementation Tips:**

- **Data Sources:** Use APIs like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage's Fundamental API, or Quandl.
- **Feature Engineering:** Normalize and handle missing values carefully.
- **Temporal Alignment:** Ensure that fundamental data aligns correctly with intraday timestamps (e.g., latest available quarterly data).

**Example:**

```python
import yfinance as yf

# Fetch fundamental data using yfinance
ticker = yf.Ticker("AAPL")
fundamentals = ticker.financials.T  # Transpose for easier handling
# Select relevant features
fund_features = fundamentals[['Total Revenue', 'Net Income', 'Earnings Per Share']]

# Merge with intraday data based on date
intraday_df['date'] = intraday_df['timestamp'].dt.date
merged_df = intraday_df.merge(fund_features, left_on='date', right_index=True, how='left')
````

**Implementation Tips:**

- **Data Sources:** Use FRED, World Bank APIs, or Alpha Vantage's Economic Indicators API.
- **Frequency Alignment:** Macroeconomic data often has lower frequency (monthly, quarterly). Align or interpolate with intraday data appropriately.

**Example:**

```python
import pandas_datareader.data as web

# Fetch GDP data from FRED
gdp = web.DataReader('GDP', 'fred', start_date, end_date)
gdp = gdp.resample('D').ffill()  # Forward fill to daily frequency

# Merge with intraday data
intraday_df['date'] = intraday_df['timestamp'].dt.date

- **Context Awareness:** Understands sentiment in the context of historical events and stock performance.

**Implementation Tips:**

- **Time-Series Sentiment Features:** Calculate moving averages, trends, and volatility of sentiment scores.
- **Contextual Embeddings:** Use models that incorporate context, such as BERT with fine-tuning on financial texts.

**Example:**

```python
# Calculate moving average of sentiment scores
df['sentiment_ma_10'] = df['sentiment_score'].rolling(window=10).mean()
df['sentiment_trend'] = df['sentiment_ma_10'].diff()

# Use historical sentiment as a feature
df['sentiment_trend'].fillna(0, inplace=True)
```
