Right now, Luqman is getting his date from yfinance API. the API calls are done 
as a part of the service layer.

In the future, the API calls will be done in its own API layer. The targets are 
1. to allow the API layer to be configurable with different API services.
2. Each API service will have its own strategy to handle the API calls as well as 
   its own adapter to convert the API response to the domain model.
   what is domain model?
   the answer is in the next line.
3. The domain model is the model that is used in the service layer. It is the model
    that is used to perform the business logic. The domain model is different from 
    the API response model. The adapter will convert the API response model to the 
    domain model.
4. This also will allow for a repository layer to be created. The repository layer 
   will be responsible for storing and retrieving the domain model from the database.
5. Finally this also allows the service layer to be more focused on the business logic and not on the API calls.

So in the future the API architecture will be as follows (Following uncle bob's clean architecture):
