### Key Points:
1. **Alpha Vantage** has helped in filling **ROA**, **ROE**, and **Debt-to-Equity** metrics that were previously unavailable.
2. **Yahoo Finance** continues to be the main source for most other metrics.
3. **Current Ratio** and **Quick Ratio** are still missing, as neither data source provided sufficient information.

### Summary of Current Data Sources and Metrics:
- Alpha Vantage has been useful in filling the gaps in some of the leverage and profitability metrics, specifically ROA, ROE, and Debt-to-Equity Ratio.
- Yahoo Finance remains the main source for valuation, profitability, growth, and cash flow metrics.
- **Missing Metrics**: Current Ratio and Quick Ratio are still not available from either Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage.

### Suggestions for Missing Metrics:
To obtain the missing **Current Ratio** and **Quick Ratio**, we can consider:
1. **Web Scraping**: Collecting data directly from financial websites that display detailed balance sheets.
2. **Other APIs**: Exploring additional financial APIs that may have better coverage of liquidity ratios.

**Note**: Depending on the availability of these metrics across different data sources, we need to evaluate whether to drop them entirely or use an alternative approach (e.g., estimated values) to avoid inconsistencies that might impact the LSTM model.
