Luqman is an AI prediction tool. in a sense, it's a glorified technical analysis tool.
and it does have technical analysis tools like moving averages, RSI, etc within.

But we need 2 more 2 tools for a higher accuracy.

A sentiment analysis tool to analyze the sentiment of the news articles.
Maybe something is ready out there but otherwise, you will need to build a tool using LLMs this time

and then the 3 third tool, is a good old financial analysis tool. 
the PE ratio, the EPS, the ROE, the ROA, the debt to equity ratio, etc.
The cash position of the company, the revenue growth, the profit growth, etc.
the current stock price compared to the intrinsic value of the company.
and compared to its assets and cash position.

All of these good old peter lynch kinda analysis.


these tools with a good loss management strategy, will make Luqman a very powerful tool.
